  "solution": "There are many ways to improve performance.\nYou can understand your performance better by using Pagespeed Insights (aim for score >85) and SpeedIndex on WebPageTest (aim for <4000 first view on Mobile 3G Nexus 5 Chrome)\nA few tips are to focus on loading less script, make sure as much script is loaded asynchronously as possible using <script async> and make sure render blocking CSS is marked as such.\nYou can also look into using the PRPL pattern and tools like PageSpeed Module on the server."
