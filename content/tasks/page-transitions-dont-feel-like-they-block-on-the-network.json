  "description": "Transitions should feel snappy as you tap around, even on a slow network, a key to perceived performance.",
  "solution": "Open the app on a simulated very slow network. Every time you tap a link/button in the app the page should respond immediately, either by:\n- Transitioning immediately to the next screen and showing a placeholder loading screen while waiting for content from the network.\n- A loading indicator is shown while the app waits for a response from the network.\n\nIf using a single-page-app (client rendered), transition the user to the next page immediately and show a skeleton screen and use any content such as title or thumbnail already available while content loads."
