  If you have only a favicon.ico, put it at the root of your site. Normally you
  won't need to use any markup. However, it's still good practice to link to it
  using the example below. Today, PNG format is recommended over .ico format
  (dimensions: 32x32px).

  ```

  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon"
  href="https://example.com/favicon.ico"><link rel="icon" type="image/png"
  href="https://example.com/favicon.png">
